* Abstract Data Types
- Abstract Data Types (ADT) :: A definition for a data type solely in
     terms of a set of values and a set of operations on that data
     type. Each ADT operation is defined by its inputs and outputs.

- Encapsulation :: Hide implementation details.

* The Need for Data Structures
Data structures organize data into more efficient programs and Object
Programming.

** Program efficiency
- Choice of data sturecture or algorithm can make the difference
  between a program running in seconds or days.
- An efficient solution minimizese its requirements of
  - space
  - time
- The cost of a solution is quantized in terms of resource that the
  solution consumes.

** Data Structures
- A physical exmaple of objects to manage: shipping containers at a dock
- They must be managed carefully and efficiently
- None can be lost
- The containers are generic but contain different cargo
- Each has an ID number
- The handlers don't need to know what's inside the container

- Many issues come up
- How may might we need to hold at any point?
- How do we keep them organized?
  - One big line?
  - Sorted by id?
  - A grid?
- Does the order in which they will be unloaded or loaded onto ships matter?

- It turns out no one solution will address all issues adequately
- Sometimes we'll need to stack them (to reverse the order)
- Sometimes we'll want to take them in the order they arrive
- Sometimes more complex solutions are required

** Selecting Data Structures
Generally want the simpliest data structure that meets requirements.

* Hardware
Software should always try to utilize all the hardware power in order to reach
maximum efficiency.

- Central Processing Unit :: Continuously follows the /fetch-decode-execute/
  /cycle./

** Recursion
- Recursion :: A programming technique in which a method calls itself
     to fulfill its purpose.
- Recursive Definiton :: A definition which uses the word or concept
     being defined in the definition itself.

Every recursive solution has a corresponding iterative solution.
